## EDA on Data Science Job Salaries

### Overview

Data Science jobs have surged in demand over recent years, making them among the most sought-after positions in the technology sector. Infact in 2012, an article in the Harvard Business Review by Thomas H. Davenport and D.J. Patil called Data Scientist as **The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century**. Since then, Data Scientist roles have increased by 650 percent, and this rise shows no sign of stopping.

Data Scientist salaries have also risen with demand; Data Scientists can typically expect to make six figures. Demand also translates into an ability to relocate far more easilyâ€”from city to city, and even internationally.
